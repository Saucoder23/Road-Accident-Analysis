# Road-Accident-Analysis

## Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of road accidents using Power BI, allowing users to gain valuable insights into accident trends, patterns, and contributing factors. The interactive dashboards and visualizations help in understanding the severity, frequency, and locations of accidents, enabling data-driven decision-making for road safety improvements.

## Key Features & Insights
Accident Frequency Analysis: Displays the number of accidents over time and by region, helping to identify accident hotspots.

Accident Severity: Breaks down the data into various severity levels (fatal, major, minor), providing insights into accident severity distribution.

Time-Based Analysis: Examines trends in road accidents based on time (e.g., by year, month, day, or time of day).

Weather and Accident Correlation: Analyzes how weather conditions correlate with the frequency and severity of accidents.

Vehicle Type Analysis: Evaluates the relationship between different types of vehicles and accident frequency.

Accident Hotspot Map: Interactive heatmap visualization showing the geographical locations of accidents for pinpointing high-risk areas.

## Technologies Used
Power BI: Used for developing the interactive reports and visualizations.

Excel/CSV Files: Raw data files used as the dataset for analysis and visualization.

## Data Insights
Understand the relationship between accidents and contributing factors (such as weather, time of day, and road types).

Gain insights into the regional patterns of accidents and identify locations that need more attention for safety measures.
